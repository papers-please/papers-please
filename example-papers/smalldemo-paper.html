      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p id="p-6">The hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5b protein is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase essential for replication of the viral RNA genome.
         <em>In vitro</em> and presumably <em>in vivo</em>, NS5b initiates RNA synthesis by a <em>de novo</em> mechanism. Different structural elements of NS5b have been reported to participate in RNA synthesis, especially a so-called
         “β-flap” and a C-terminal segment (designated “linker”) that connects the catalytic core of NS5b to a transmembrane anchor.
         High concentrations of GTP have also been shown to stimulate <em>de novo</em> RNA synthesis by HCV NS5b. Here we describe a combined structural and functional analysis of genotype 1 HCV-NS5b of strains
         H77 (subtype 1a), for which no structure has been previously reported, and J4 (subtype 1b). Our results highlight the linker
         as directly involved in lifting the first boundary to processive RNA synthesis, the formation of the first dinucleotide primer.
         The transition from this first dinucleotide primer state to processive RNA synthesis requires removal of the linker and of
         the β-flap with which it is shown to strongly interact in crystal structures of HCV NS5b. We find that GTP specifically stimulates
         this transition irrespective of its incorporation in neosynthesized RNA.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p id="p-7">Hepatitis C virus (HCV)<a id="xref-fn-13-1" class="xref-fn" href="#fn-13"><sup>7</sup></a> is a member of the Flaviviridae family that induces severe liver disease in humans (<a id="xref-ref-1-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-1">1</a>). The viral genome is a single-stranded RNA of positive polarity containing a single open reading frame (ORF) flanked by
         two untranslated regions (UTRs), the 5′-UTR and 3′-UTR. The single ORF is translated into a large (∼3000 residues) polyprotein
         that is processed into some 10 mature proteins. Thus, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) NS5b is cleaved from the C terminus
         of the polyprotein. <em>In vivo</em> the 591-residue NS5b is the central player in the synthesis of new genomic RNAs, in association with other viral and cellular
         proteins. This viral replication complex is associated with membranes (<a id="xref-ref-2-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-2">2</a>) with the highly hydrophobic C-terminal 21 residues of NS5b forming a transmembrane helix (<a id="xref-ref-3-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-3">3</a>). <em>In vitro</em>, NS5b has been shown to be capable of template-directed RNA synthesis on its own, requiring only divalent metals (magnesium
         or manganese) as cofactors. Indeed, NS5b can catalyze both <em>de novo</em> synthesis from a single-stranded template (<a id="xref-ref-4-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-4">4</a>) and primer extension from the subsequent RNA duplex or from a preannealed template/primer duplex. The NS5b C-terminal transmembrane
         helix is dispensable for these activities, and C-terminal deletions of 21 residues (NS5b_Δ21) or more (NS5b_Δ47 to NS5b_Δ60)
         have been used in most activity and all crystallographic studies. The latter (<a id="xref-ref-5-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-5">5</a><span class="xref-sep">,</span><a id="xref-ref-6-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-6">–</a><span class="xref-sep">,</span><a id="xref-ref-7-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-7">7</a>) has shown that the catalytic core of NS5b comprises residues 1–530 (<a id="xref-fig-1-1" class="xref-fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a><em>E</em>). They have also brought a puzzle to light; the 40-residue stretch (termed “linker” throughout this manuscript) between the
         catalytic core (fingers, palm, and thumb, <a id="xref-fig-1-2" class="xref-fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>) and the C-terminal membrane anchor occludes the catalytic cleft (<a id="xref-ref-5-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-5">5</a>) in the crystal structures in which it is present (<em>i.e.</em> _Δ21 forms). The only reported exception is the case of the consensus subtype 2a NS5b_Δ21 (<a id="xref-ref-8-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-8">8</a>), where two conformations of the same construct were crystallized, one with the linker in its usual, occluding position and
         one with the linker disordered. The arrangement of the linker in the active site of NS5b_Δ21 can be disrupted by mutations
         of critical linker residues interacting with the β-flap (<a id="xref-fig-1-3" class="xref-fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a><em>B</em>) of the thumb domain (<a id="xref-ref-9-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-9">9</a>). The β-flap itself was proposed to participate in initiation of RNA synthesis by selective (<a id="xref-ref-10-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-10">10</a>) and precise (<a id="xref-ref-11-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-11">11</a>) positioning of a single-stranded RNA template along the finger RNA binding cleft, a prerequisite for proper <em>de novo</em> initiation.

All residues thus highlighted are strictly conserved among HCV strains, except the two <em>underlined</em>. Position 556 is always a short hydrophilic residue (Gly, Ser, Asp, or Asn), and position 446 is always an acidic residue
               that is conserved within genotypes (Glu for 1a, 2, and 5; Asp for 3, 4, and 6), except for subtype 1b, where 446 is a conserved

Note that the well defined
               lysine 556 side chain points into the region occupied by the P GTP in <em>C. E</em>, shown is the primary structure of HVC_NS5b. The C-terminal transmembrane anchor, deleted from the constructs used in this
               study, is in <em>dark gray</em>.

      <p id="p-9">In the present work we present a parallel structural and functional characterization of subtype 1a (H77 strain) and subtype
         1b (J4 strain) NS5b enzymes with the aim of shedding new light on the puzzle of the linker involvement in the initiation of
         RNA synthesis. Our structural results include the first crystal structures of subtype 1a H77_NS5b_Δ21 alone and in complex
         with GTP and crystal structures of subtype 1b J4_NS5b_Δ21 in a new crystal form and of a mutant of the linker. A small-angle
         x-ray scattering (SAXS) characterization of J4_NS5b_Δ21 was also performed to assess the conformation of NS5b in solution.
         Functional analyses were done by <em>in vitro</em> RdRp assays of H77_NS5b_Δ21 and J4_NS5b_Δ21 (wild type and linker mutants). Taken together, these results clarify the early
         steps of RNA synthesis by HCV-NS5b; on the one hand, they point to the direct involvement of the linker in the very first
         steps of <em>de novo</em> initiation of RNA synthesis, leading to formation of the first dinucleotide primer. On the other hand, they show that GTP
         stimulates a later transition to processive elongation that is the true rate-limiting step in initiation.
