      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p id="p-6">The hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5b protein is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase essential for replication of the viral RNA genome.
         <em>In vitro</em> and presumably <em>in vivo</em>, NS5b initiates RNA synthesis by a <em>de novo</em> mechanism. Different structural elements of NS5b have been reported to participate in RNA synthesis, especially a so-called
         “β-flap” and a C-terminal segment (designated “linker”) that connects the catalytic core of NS5b to a transmembrane anchor.
         High concentrations of GTP have also been shown to stimulate <em>de novo</em> RNA synthesis by HCV NS5b. Here we describe a combined structural and functional analysis of genotype 1 HCV-NS5b of strains
         H77 (subtype 1a), for which no structure has been previously reported, and J4 (subtype 1b). Our results highlight the linker
         as directly involved in lifting the first boundary to processive RNA synthesis, the formation of the first dinucleotide primer.
         The transition from this first dinucleotide primer state to processive RNA synthesis requires removal of the linker and of
         the β-flap with which it is shown to strongly interact in crystal structures of HCV NS5b. We find that GTP specifically stimulates
         this transition irrespective of its incorporation in neosynthesized RNA.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p id="p-7">Hepatitis C virus (HCV)<a id="xref-fn-13-1" class="xref-fn" href="#fn-13"><sup>7</sup></a> is a member of the Flaviviridae family that induces severe liver disease in humans (<a id="xref-ref-1-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-1">1</a>). The viral genome is a single-stranded RNA of positive polarity containing a single open reading frame (ORF) flanked by
         two untranslated regions (UTRs), the 5′-UTR and 3′-UTR. The single ORF is translated into a large (∼3000 residues) polyprotein
         that is processed into some 10 mature proteins. Thus, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) NS5b is cleaved from the C terminus
         of the polyprotein. <em>In vivo</em> the 591-residue NS5b is the central player in the synthesis of new genomic RNAs, in association with other viral and cellular
         proteins. This viral replication complex is associated with membranes (<a id="xref-ref-2-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-2">2</a>) with the highly hydrophobic C-terminal 21 residues of NS5b forming a transmembrane helix (<a id="xref-ref-3-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-3">3</a>). <em>In vitro</em>, NS5b has been shown to be capable of template-directed RNA synthesis on its own, requiring only divalent metals (magnesium
         or manganese) as cofactors. Indeed, NS5b can catalyze both <em>de novo</em> synthesis from a single-stranded template (<a id="xref-ref-4-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-4">4</a>) and primer extension from the subsequent RNA duplex or from a preannealed template/primer duplex. The NS5b C-terminal transmembrane
         helix is dispensable for these activities, and C-terminal deletions of 21 residues (NS5b_Δ21) or more (NS5b_Δ47 to NS5b_Δ60)
         have been used in most activity and all crystallographic studies. The latter (<a id="xref-ref-5-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-5">5</a><span class="xref-sep">,</span><a id="xref-ref-6-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-6">–</a><span class="xref-sep">,</span><a id="xref-ref-7-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-7">7</a>) has shown that the catalytic core of NS5b comprises residues 1–530 (<a id="xref-fig-1-1" class="xref-fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a><em>E</em>). They have also brought a puzzle to light; the 40-residue stretch (termed “linker” throughout this manuscript) between the
         catalytic core (fingers, palm, and thumb, <a id="xref-fig-1-2" class="xref-fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>) and the C-terminal membrane anchor occludes the catalytic cleft (<a id="xref-ref-5-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-5">5</a>) in the crystal structures in which it is present (<em>i.e.</em> _Δ21 forms). The only reported exception is the case of the consensus subtype 2a NS5b_Δ21 (<a id="xref-ref-8-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-8">8</a>), where two conformations of the same construct were crystallized, one with the linker in its usual, occluding position and
         one with the linker disordered. The arrangement of the linker in the active site of NS5b_Δ21 can be disrupted by mutations
         of critical linker residues interacting with the β-flap (<a id="xref-fig-1-3" class="xref-fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a><em>B</em>) of the thumb domain (<a id="xref-ref-9-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-9">9</a>). The β-flap itself was proposed to participate in initiation of RNA synthesis by selective (<a id="xref-ref-10-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-10">10</a>) and precise (<a id="xref-ref-11-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-11">11</a>) positioning of a single-stranded RNA template along the finger RNA binding cleft, a prerequisite for proper <em>de novo</em> initiation.

      <p id="p-9">In the present work we present a parallel structural and functional characterization of subtype 1a (H77 strain) and subtype
         1b (J4 strain) NS5b enzymes with the aim of shedding new light on the puzzle of the linker involvement in the initiation of
         RNA synthesis. Our structural results include the first crystal structures of subtype 1a H77_NS5b_Δ21 alone and in complex
         with GTP and crystal structures of subtype 1b J4_NS5b_Δ21 in a new crystal form and of a mutant of the linker. A small-angle
         x-ray scattering (SAXS) characterization of J4_NS5b_Δ21 was also performed to assess the conformation of NS5b in solution.
         Functional analyses were done by <em>in vitro</em> RdRp assays of H77_NS5b_Δ21 and J4_NS5b_Δ21 (wild type and linker mutants). Taken together, these results clarify the early
         steps of RNA synthesis by HCV-NS5b; on the one hand, they point to the direct involvement of the linker in the very first
         steps of <em>de novo</em> initiation of RNA synthesis, leading to formation of the first dinucleotide primer. On the other hand, they show that GTP
         stimulates a later transition to processive elongation that is the true rate-limiting step in initiation.

               <h5>Crystal Structure of H77_NS5b and Comparison with J4_NS5b</h5>

               <p id="p-29">We report here to high resolution the first structure of an NS5b of subtype 1a. The construct we used in the structural studies
                  is a Q65H point mutant of strain H77_NS5b_Δ21. The Q65H mutation was isolated from a chronically infected chimpanzee, where
                  it became fixed in the dominant virus present in the blood of the infected animal. The H77_NS5bQ65H_Δ21 construct was previously
                  found to be even more active than the wild type in <em>in vitro</em> assays (<a id="xref-ref-14-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-14">14</a>). We obtained two related crystal forms (X1 and X2) of H77_NS5bQ65H_Δ21 with, respectively, three and two molecules in the
                  asymmetric units, yielding five high resolution views of the subtype 1a NS5b (<a id="xref-table-wrap-2-3" class="xref-table" href="#T2">Table 2</a>). We subjected these five views to an objective conformational pairwise comparison with the program ESCET (<a id="xref-ref-21-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-21">21</a>). <a id="xref-table-wrap-3-1" class="xref-table" href="#T3">Table 3</a> shows that we may ascribe the five molecules to two groups; X1_A, X1_B, and X2_A on the one hand and X1_C and X2_B on the
                  other hand. The molecules are conformationally identical within each group but display small conformational differences between
                  groups. These differences are ascribable to different crystal packing environments and are significant with a tolerance of
                  2.5 σ but not of 5 σ (<a id="xref-table-wrap-3-2" class="xref-table" href="#T3">Table 3</a>, numbers in parentheses). In contrast, a structure of subtype 1b NS5b (strain J4, with nearly 90% sequence identity to H77_NS5b)
                  is significantly different from all five views of H77_NS5b even with a tolerance of 5 σ (<a id="xref-table-wrap-3-3" class="xref-table" href="#T3">Table 3</a>, <em>last column</em>). We may, therefore, break up the NS5b structure in subdomains according to the conformational differences between 1a and
                  1b enzymes (<a id="xref-ref-27-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-27">27</a>). This analysis is pictured in <a id="xref-fig-2-1" class="xref-fig" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a>. It shows that the main conformational difference lies in the shift of a block made of the structural elements taking part
                  in the fingertips/thumb interaction, including helix A of the fingertips and helix S of the thumb. This difference leads to
                  a maximum shift in this region in C-α position of 3.5 Å between J4_ and H77_NS5b (0.6 Å overall). In contrast, the part of
                  the thumb (including the linker and β-flap) not directly involved in interactions with the fingertips is in the same rigid
                  block as the palm and fingers.

               <h5>Crystal Structure of H77_NS5b in Complex with GTP</h5>

               <p id="p-34">We reasoned that the absence of substrates in the H77_NS5b structure might be due to the presence of sulfate ions in the buffer,
                  competing with the phosphate backbone of RNA and/or the triphosphate moieties of nucleotides. Therefore, we soaked crystals
                  with solutions containing concentrated RNAs and/or nucleotides and no sulfates (see “Experimental Procedures”). These crystals
                  belonged to the different space group X2 (<a id="xref-table-wrap-2-5" class="xref-table" href="#T2">Table 2</a>), although whether from the soaking step or the seeding procedure with which they were obtained (see “Experimental Procedures”)
                  is unknown. In the case of all soaks containing GTP (but with no other nucleotide), electron density for several nucleotides
                  was apparent (<a id="xref-fig-1-5" class="xref-fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>, <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, and <em>C</em>). Particularly interesting is the better ordered GTP (denoted <em>P</em> in <a id="xref-fig-1-6" class="xref-fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a><em>C</em>) present in the active site region. Its triphosphate moiety is stabilized by residues Arg-158, Arg-386, and Ser-367, the
                  conserved triad identified as part of the priming site for a large class of <em>de novo</em> initiating RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (<a id="xref-ref-28-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-28">28</a>). The base is sandwiched between residues 556 and 557 of the linker (depicted in <em>light brown</em> in <a id="xref-fig-1-7" class="xref-fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>) and the base of another, less well ordered nucleotide. Hydrogen bonds of the P GTP through its N1 and N2 to the carbonyl
                  of Ser-282 seem to be the specificity determinant of this site for GTP. Finally, the ribose is held firmly in place by a bifurcated
                  hydrogen bond between its 2′- and 3′-OH and Glu-446 of the β-flap (<a id="xref-fig-1-8" class="xref-fig" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a><em>C</em>) and by a hydrogen bond between its 2′-OH and the hydroxyl of Ser-556. Rather weak density for several other GTP molecules
                  is localized at interfaces between NS5b molecules.
